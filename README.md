# Hello, World

As any programmer worth their salt will tell you, running a program to display the words `Hello, World!` is the first thing you must learn how to do. There is many reasons for this convention but the main reason, and the only one that matters, is as follows. A hello world program shows you the basics of the language. From this simple (or relitively simple) program the basics of an entire language can be constructed.

## Why Python?

Python has long been hailed as the perfect beginers language. Its simple syntax and relaxed layout allows newbies to grasp complicated concepts with ease. Despite being simple, Python is not a childs toy. When utilised properly Python can achieve blazing fast speeds and advanced computations. This is becasue Python, much like the internet, is built on top of a shaky foundation of complex depndencies and wrappers. Hundreds of libraries andmodules have been written with the sole purpose of providing fast reliable functions, classes, and API's. In laymens terms, if you want to make something with python, chances are someone much smarter has already done it for you.

In summary, Python is simple, but ~~lazy~~ powerfull.

And so, with Python being a massively succssessfull language, there are natuarally hundreds of thousands of tutorials that guide you from noob to master. And, more relevant to our topic, there have been hundreds of essays written on the best method to imlement a  Hello World script in python. So naturally, in my humbleness, anything I create is nothing compared to those experts. But, I have decided to try anyway. This is my attempt at the perfect hello world script. The code is available in the hello.py file. I have included a hefty amount of comments pointing out various python features, style choices, best practices, and an in depth explenation of how the hello world script works.
